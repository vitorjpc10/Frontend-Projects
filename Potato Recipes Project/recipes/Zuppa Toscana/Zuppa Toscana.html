     <h2><strong>Recipe Description:</strong></h2>
     <p>Loaded with crisp bacon, Italian sausage, cream,
          garlic and parmesan cheese, plus a few veggies thrown in for
          good measure— zuppa toscana is basically everything great on earth,
          cooked together in one big delicious pot.
          “Zuppa Toscana means “Tuscan soup”, and as for the origins
          of the recipe, well, the soup that the Olive Garden serves is
          a very American derivative of a Tuscan soup, and it’s honestly
          not too similar to any soup that you’d traditionally be served in
          Tuscany. But that’s OK! While we love authentic Italian food as
          much as the next, there’s plenty of room in our hearts (and stomachs)
          for Italian-American riffs, too. Particularly when they’re this
          yummy.</p>

     <h2><strong>Recipe Ingredients:</strong></h2>
     <ul>
          <em>
               <li>Bacon</li>
               <li>Olive Oil</li>
               <li>Italian Sausage</li>
               <li>Yellow Onion</li>
               <li>Garlic</li>
               <li>Chicken Stock</li>
               <li>Chili Powder</li>
               <li>Russet Potatoes</li>
               <li>Zucchini</li>
               <li>Heavy Cream</li>
               <li>Kale</li>
               <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
               <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
          </em>
     </ul>

     <h2><strong>Cooking Steps:</strong></h2>
     <ol>
          <li>Cook the bacon and resist the urge to eat it all. Stop it! Put down the bacon. It’ll be worth the wait.
               Save a bit of bacon fat to use as a base for the soup.</li>
          <li>While you fry the bacon, cook the sausage. Don’t just brown it, cook it all the way through!</li>
          <li>Fry the onion in bacon fat in a Dutch oven or stock pot. Add the garlic after a few minutes.</li>
          <li>Stir in chicken stock, and add chili powder, potatoes and zucchini and bring the whole pot to a boil. Now
               it’s starting to feel like there might actually be zuppa toscana in your future!</li>
          <li>Simmer until the potatoes are tender</li>
          <li>Stir in cooked sausage, cream, kale, some parmesan and most of the bacon.</li>
          <li>When the kale is wilted, the soup is done! Garnish with more bacon, parmesan cheese, and red pepper
               flakes.</li>
     </ol>
