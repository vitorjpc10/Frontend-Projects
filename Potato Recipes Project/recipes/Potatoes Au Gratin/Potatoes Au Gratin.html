     <h2><strong>Recipe Description:</strong></h2>
     <p>Whether you’re looking to up your holiday side dish game, or simply for a cozy, indulgent way to spruce up your
          next dinner party menu, these homemade au gratin potatoes are a winner every time. Laden with nutty Gruyère
          and the umami-punch of Parmesan cheese, and baked in a bath of silky cream, they’re an edible embodiment of
          Mae West’s fabulous adage—”too much of a good thing can be wonderful.” Classic potatoes au gratin are
          everything a holiday dish is supposed to be—elegant, rich, luxurious, extraordinary—and this particular au
          gratin recipe is the best of the best.</p>

     <h2><strong>Recipe Ingredients:</strong></h2>
     <ul>
          <em>
               <li><strong>Potatoes</strong> <em>Obviously. We call for russet potatoes in our au gratin recipe, but
                         Yukon Golds are also delicious. Bonus: if you use Yukons, you don’t have to peel them.</li>
               <li><strong>Butter</strong> We can’t get enough of it this time of year.</li>
               <li><strong>Heavy cream</strong> See above.</li>
               <li><strong>Cheese mix</strong> The combination of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and nutty Swiss
                    Gruyère—the world’s best melting cheese, if you ask us—makes for the best potatoes au gratin. End of
                    Story.</li>
          </em>
     </ul>

     <h2><strong>Cooking Steps:</strong></h2>

     
     <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 400°F.</li>
          <li>In a small sauce pan add heavy cream, garlic, nutmeg and 3 tbsp of the butter and set over low heat.</li>
          <li>Using a mandolin slice potatoes ⅛ inch thick and immediate place in a large bowl of cold water. Once all
               potatoes are sliced, rinse and pat completely dry.</li>
          <li>Using 1 tbsp of butter lightly grease a 9X13 baking dish or 12 inch circular pan.</li>
          <li>Arrange a single layer of potatoes on the bottom of the pan, lightly season with salt and pepper and
               sprinkle with gruyere cheese. Continue this process of layering until potatoes are all used up. (Be sure
               to reserve a little cheese for the top.)</li>
          <li>Slowly pour the warm cream mixture over the potatoes and gently press down on the potatoes with your hands
               to make sure all liquid is evenly dispersed. Sprinkle with remaining gruyere and parmesan cheese.</li>
          <li>Cover the pan with foil and bake for 50 minutes covered, remove foil and continue to bake for another 25
               minutes.</li>
          <li>Top with fresh greens and serve warm.</li>

     </ol>
