     <h2><strong>Recipe Description:</strong></h2>
     <p>Versions of picadillo can be found all over Latin America and there’s plenty of variance from region to region
          as well as family to family. Classic Cuban picadillo is defined by the addition of briny green olives and
          sweet raisins, while other versions are heavier on the potatoes. Some use tons of fresh tomatoes, some use
          paste, some are tomato-less. But the unifying thing is the dish’s namesake meaty base of ground or minced
          beef, because the Spanish word “picadillo” in English means “minced” or “hash” deriving from the root “picar”
          which means “to chop”. While we love olives as much as the next person, when it comes to making picadillo, we
          like to keep it as simple as possible. So, our picadillo recipe is more like what you’d find in Mexico than
          Cuba—in other words, no raisins or olives here, but plenty of warm spices and an umami hit from a good squeeze
          of tomato paste, too.</p>
